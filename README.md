# Image Classification With Python TensorFlow
An image classification program written in Python 3.6 using TensorFlow and Keras. Six image data sets are included. All images are from Google Image searches. I do not own any of the images. I am very young and inexperienced so feedback would be appreciated.

import numpy as np
